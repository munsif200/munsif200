My research journey has been driven by a passion for understanding and advancing the frontiers of artificial intelligence and its applications in real-world scenarios. I focus on the intersection of computer vision and deep learning, with particular emphasis on developing robust algorithms that can operate in challenging environments, including low-light and dark conditions.

## Research Interests

### Computer Vision
My work in computer vision encompasses object detection, image segmentation, action recognition, and scene understanding. I am particularly interested in developing algorithms that can work in challenging lighting conditions, including low-light and pitch-dark environments, with applications in industrial and transportation domains.

### Deep Learning
I specialize in designing efficient neural network architectures for various applications, including convolutional neural networks for image analysis and attention-based frameworks. My research includes work on tubelet networks, hierarchical attention mechanisms, and optimization techniques for real-world deployment.

### Intelligent Transportation Systems
My research in intelligent transportation involves developing AI-powered solutions for autonomous vehicles, including collision avoidance systems using proximal policy optimization, motion planning algorithms, and safety enhancement technologies. This includes work on sensor fusion, path planning, and decision-making algorithms for self-driving cars.

### Virtual and Augmented Reality
In the realm of VR/AR, I focus on developing educational applications, serious games for science education, and immersive training environments. My work contributes to making these technologies more accessible and effective for learning and industrial applications.

### Materials Informatics
I apply machine learning techniques to accelerate materials discovery and characterization, with a focus on hierarchical attention-based frameworks for enhanced prediction and optimization of organic and inorganic material synthesis. This interdisciplinary work combines domain knowledge in materials science with advanced computational methods.
